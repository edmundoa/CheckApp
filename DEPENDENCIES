CheckApp v0.1.1 dependencies
============================

In order to run CheckApp, you need the following software:

    - Django 1.2
    - Python >=2.5 <3.0
    - South 0.7.x
    - python-imaging
    - MySQL >=5

If you want to deploy CheckApp on a production server, you will also need:

    - Apache
    - mod_wsgi for Apache
    - A mail server (to recover passwords). I like Postfix, but it's up to
      you.
