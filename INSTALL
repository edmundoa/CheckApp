CheckApp 0.1.1 Installation
===========================

To install CheckApp on a development server, you have to follow these steps:

    1. Install Python 2.5 or higher (but don't use Python 3). The easiest
       way to do it is to install it from your distro's repositories. Install
       also python-imaging from the repositories.
    
    2. Install Django 1.2 on that server. Django website has a nice guide
       to install it:
            https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/intro/install/
    
    3. Install South on the server. Here is a guide to do it:
            http://south.aeracode.org/docs/installation.html
    
    4. Install MySQL on the server. You also need to create an schema
       called "checkapp" and a user with permissions to handle that
       schema.
    
    5. Decompress CheckApp tarball on your system. Go to that folder using
       a terminal and enter to "checkapp" folder.
        
        5.1. Edit "settings.py", changing your database data, E-Mail settings,
             DEBUG flag, TIME_ZONE, MEDIA_ROOT, SECRET_KEY and TEMPLATE_DIRS
             to fit your installation. Here is a guide to generate a new
             SECRET_KEY:

        5.2. Execute "python manage.py syncdb" on your terminal to generate
             database tables. It will ask you to create an admin for the admin
             interface. I recommend you doing that.
        
        5.3. If you want to change your server domain name, you can access
             to your database, and modify data on 'django_site' table.
        
        5.4. Now it's time to run your development server. Just execute
             "python manage.py runserver 8080", and you should access to
             your own CheckApp going to:
                http://localhost:8080
        
        5.5. Before starting using CheckApp, you need to add some Platforms,
             Categories and Pins objects manually. Use the admin interface
             or Django's shell to add them.

Remember that using Django's server is not intended for a production server,
so don't use the previous steps to run CheckApp on a production server!
